# Contributing to Pony Patterns

Hi there! Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pony Patterns. The book is being developed in Markdown. We welcome external contributors. In fact, we encourage them.

## How to format your Pattern

Pony Patterns is a series of cookbook style recipes. What does this mean? Each section of the book should be focused on solving a specific problem in Pony. Additionally, it should follow the pattern "Problem" -> "Solution" -> "Discussion".

"Problem" should be centered around what we are trying to accomplish. Give some background on why a person might want to read this pattern. Keep it reasonably short. Most people will find the pattern they need by scanning through the problem sections. They might also find it by searching so make sure to try and include like keywords in the natural flow of your description.

"Solution" should give code that solves the problem and then breaks it down into smaller chunks for discussion of what the individual section of code do. You don't have to cover every section of code, just the parts that are tricky or specific to the solution. Keep the code as minimal as possible and focused on the problem at hand.

"Discussion" should cover any additional content that might be of interest, what other solutions the reader might want to look at and any general conclusions to be drawn. Is the solution slow? Potentially hard to maintain? That should be covered as part of "Discussion".

Each pattern should start with the name of pattern as a level one header: `#` in Markdown. With "Problem", "Solution" and "Discussion" each as second level headers: `##`. If you need to have any subsections, make them a third level heading: `###`. If you find yourself reaching for a forth level heading, stop and figure out a different way to present the info in that section.

Avoid hard-wrapping lines within paragraphs (using line breaks in the middle of or between sentences to make lines shorter than a certain length). Instead, turn on soft-wrapping in your editor and expect the documentation renderer to let the text flow to the width of the container.

## Where to put your pattern

All patterns go in the top level of the repo within a directory for the appropriate section. If an appropriate section doesn't exist, create one and then add pattern within that directory. For example, to add a new section called `Networking`, you'd create a new folder `networking` then you can add your pattern to the directory. If you are creating a new section, add an `index.md` file that has the name of section as a level one entry: `#` in Markdown as well as description of the type of patterns to be found in the section.

## How to update the Table of Contents

Table of contents is handled by the `Summary.md` file. Each section of the book will appear as a top level item in the list contained in `Summary.md`. Each pattern in turn appears as sub item beneath that. If you added a new section, don't forget to link to both the section `index.md` as well as the content for your pattern.

## How to submit a pattern

Once your content is done, please open a pull request against this repo with your changes. Based on the state of your particular PR, a number of requests for change might be requested:

* Changes to the content
* Change to where the content appears in the Table of Contents
* Change to where the markdown file for the pattern is stored in the repo

Be sure to keep your PR to a single pattern. If you are working on multiple patterns, make sure they are each on their own branch and that before creating a new branch that you are on the main branch (others multiple patterns might end up in your pull request). Each PR should be for a single logical change. We request that you create a good commit messages as laid out in  ['How to Write a Git Commit Message'](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

If your PR is for a single logical change (which is should be) but spans multiple commits, we'll ask you to squash them into a single commit before we merge. Steve Klabnik wrote a handy guide for that:  [How to squash commits in a GitHub pull request](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request).
