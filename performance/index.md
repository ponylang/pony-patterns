# Performance

Why are you interested in Pony? We bet at least a bit of your answer involves its promise of high performance code. When it comes to writing code that runs fast, Pony sets you up for sucess in a way that few languages do. That said, you can still write slow code.

The patterns in this chapter aim to help teach you a variety of tricks to help you write fast code. Most of them will focus on one or both of the following:
